# Spaceman Project Proposal

## Project Description

My app is called Spaceman. It's a game where players are provided a string of blank spaces(pun intended) and it is their goal to guess the letters of the word! When the player guesses a correct letter from the hidden word, that letter is added into the blank space. When the player makes an incorrect guess, the astronaut adds a part to his/her ship. If the player fills in all the blank spaces and guesses the correct word, the player wins! If the player incorrectly guesses too many times, the astronaut will take off in his spaceship. Users will have the option to play again or reset.
